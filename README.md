    Bellissimo

<h3 align="center" style="margin: 0px;">
    Affiliate tracker. Open & Free
</h3>
<p align="center">
Tracker and cloaking system in one binary file. Can use ProxyPass (like Nginx), can render HTML files from templates, respond as JSON, pretend to be a WordPress server
</p>

## Setup Guide
Get the app running locally in the following way:

```bash
git clone https://t.ly/ZJa4C

cd bellissimo

docker-compose up -d
```

## Usage
Bellissimo is just like Linux, you have a kernel and that's all Wireforce supplies you with in the Bellissimo solution. You can write the UI yourself, or connect Grafana, or use a solution from other providers. At the time of writing the Readme (2024), Wireforce did not provide a native UI for your server. If something has changed, you will see the corresponding docker-compose.yml. Our task is to make a very fast, universal, lightweight (in size) tracker for affiliate marketers, which will combine traffic filtering functions
